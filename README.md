## Problem Statement
### Business Understanding
BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands
## Business Objective
- It's required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
- They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
